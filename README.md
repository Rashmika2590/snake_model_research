# Active Contour Model (Snake) for Image Segmentation

This project implements and evaluates an Active Contour Model (ACM) for image segmentation. It provides both a standard serial implementation and a highly optimized parallel version using Numba to demonstrate the performance benefits of parallelization.

## Project Structure

- `/src`: Source code for the ACM implementations, utilities, and configuration.
- `/tests`: Test scripts for ensuring code correctness.
- `/data`: Sample images for testing and benchmarking.
- `/results`: Output images, performance logs, and plots.
- `run_benchmarks.py`: A script to automate the performance evaluation.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Generate Test Data:**
    The required test images can be generated by running the script in the `tests` directory.
    ```bash
    python3 tests/generate_test_images.py
    ```

## Usage

You can run the Active Contour Model on a single image using `src/main.py`.

### Serial Execution

To run the standard serial version:
```bash
python3 src/main.py --image data/circle_256.png --mode serial
```

### Parallel Execution

To run the Numba-optimized parallel version:
```bash
python3 src/main.py --image data/circle_256.png --mode parallel
```

The output images will be saved in the `/results` directory.

## Performance Benchmarking

To reproduce the performance evaluation and generate the comparison plots, run the `run_benchmarks.py` script from the root directory.

```bash
python3 run_benchmarks.py
```

This script will:
1.  Run both serial and parallel implementations on all test images (`256x256`, `512x512`, `1024x1024`).
2.  Log the execution times to `results/performance_log.csv`.
3.  Generate and save the following plots in the `results` directory:
    -   `execution_time_vs_size.png`
    -   `speedup_vs_size.png`

The final performance analysis can be found in `results/performance_report.md`.
